### DESCRIPTION
Our team here at AXA is playing a fantasy role-playing game and every time the heroes they play
arrive at a town, they have the issue. They don't know the local population and what they can do to
help them on their adventures.

This is one of these times, our heroes just arrived at a Gnome town called Brastlewark. To facilitate
trade with the local population they need an easy way to browse all the inhabitants details.
We've found a server providing all the census data
of Brastlewark at the following address:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrafols/mobile_test/master/data.json

Gnomes in this town are not really social because they have too much work to do. That's the
reason they can have more than one job and might have few or even no friends at all. They also
appreciate their privacy so they've used some random images from internet, not specifically
optimized for mobile devices, for their profile. (They are very modern in some aspects and they
have smartphones and access to internet for instance).
Please write an application to help our team.
